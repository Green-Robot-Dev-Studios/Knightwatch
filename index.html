          <p class="card-blurb line-clamp">Starting this school year, all grade 9 math classes in Ontario are being offered in only one stream. In previous years, students chose one of three streams (academic, applied, or essential) which had different curriculum expectations and assessment methods. Generally, students taking academic math in grades 9 and 10 then took “university” level math in grades 11 and 12, while applied students moved to “college” level math. Most subjects (English, French, sciences, and geography) are streamed in all grades, while some are not streamed at all, such as the arts, physical education, and Spanish.<br>The Government of Ontario is de-streaming grade ...</p>

For the past three years I’ve been at Nepean High School and I always passed by, but I never bought anything. I recently decided to take a chance and try out what is so highly regarded by students at Nepean.<br> S&amp;G Fries has the typical “shack menu”: fries, poutine, burgers, hot dogs, and chicken fingers, along with egg rolls from the Golden Bowl. I chose to get a small poutine.<br>I received my order very quickly, and ...</p>
