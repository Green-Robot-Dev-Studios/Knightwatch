On one fateful Halloween, a couple of kids gone trick-or-treating without their parents and stumble across the creepy old house across the street, they both pandered the thought of knocking it’s door but town’s people warned them of the dangers— the little kids batted their eyes and betted that they would be fine; walking up to the house the town’s people ...</p>

The event was filled with freezies, music and lots of chalk drawings! It also served as a chance for students to get to know some of their StudCo representatives. Overall, the event was a huge success. Lots of students showed up just to hang out and to write lots of encouraging messages on the sidewalk along with various drawings. This event is just the beginning of StudCo’s plans for exciting events in the upcoming school year. This is the first year we’ve ...</p>

A universally durable and versatile construction material, concrete is the second most consumed substance in the world, right behind water. <br>As it stands, it’s hard to revise the widespread use of this material, which has been in use since its origins in Rome, 200 BC.

Key Club got a giant donation of clothing from a local second hand store, Plato’s Closet, and students could either swap their own clothing for another item or buy an item of clothing.

Some people will play until they defeat the ender dragon (and arguably beat the game), while others will stick around to grab their loot.

One of these books, a tricoloured novel of black, white, and red, has one of the most simplistically beautiful covers I've ever seen. The title, written in a simple, legible font, reads "The Night Circus." A vague and interesting title, I curiously flip to the back to find out more. A duel between magicians?<br>"Huh, it sounds a lot like a mix between Caraval and..." I say.<br>"No, no," one of my other friends says, smiling.

Instead of the alternated semestered system that OCDSB was previously using, students have returned to four classes a day which is the way high school ran before the pandemic.

As Black History Month comes to an end, it’s important to recognize the racial issues in our tech-fueled world, where AI algorithms are present from security cameras to sending a text to your friend. Any bias in these algorithms can result in massive, systemic issues that disproportionately affect Black individuals.<br>These machines learn ...</p>

          <p class="card-blurb line-clamp">Before starting the new season of hockey I was worried. I was worried I wouldn't be strong enough, fast enough or big enough. Three months in, I’ve learned a lot. I know I’m physically strong enough and I don’t know why I was so scared. So far it’s been an amazing season, but the three girls, myself included, have experienced moments that showed us that co-ed hockey (“boys hockey”) isn’t fully adjusted to the concept of girls in hockey. It feels like we will never be seen as hockey players, always as girl-hockey players. <br>Walking into rinks before games, I’m ...</p>

          <p class="card-blurb line-clamp">2020 was a hard year for people all around the globe. When the world familiarized itself with COVID-19, it came with a significant rise in anti-Asian sentiment. Before we knew it, everyone with black hair and almond eyes was burdened with the blame of a whole pandemic.

          <p class="card-blurb line-clamp"><br>The Sun is Also a Star by Jamaican-American author Nicola Yoon is amazing, suspenseful, engaging, and it really makes you think. I believe that one major reason you should read this book is because of the writing style. Nicola Yoon has written this book so well. She uses expressive language, powerful imagery and describes everything so well. Even though the novel covers the events of only a single day, I never got bored reading it. In fact, I couldn’t put it down. Another reason this book is a must-read is because the characters are teenagers, so they are so relatable. ...</p>

          <p class="card-blurb line-clamp">If it’s a rainy day or you’re just looking for something to do, you’re probably going to go see a movie. I would too as it’s a great way to spend a miserable day or a brisk evening. The theatres always have a wide variety of movies, some good, some bad. Few are bad; however, those that are, are made very obvious. One of which is Sony’s Venom: Let There Be Carnage. This movie was a complete and utter waste of my and my family's time. Not one of us enjoyed it.  <br>       ...</p>

          <p class="card-blurb line-clamp">Starting this school year, all grade 9 math classes in Ontario are being offered in only one stream. In previous years, students chose one of three streams (academic, applied, or essential) which had different curriculum expectations and assessment methods. Generally, students taking academic math in grades 9 and 10 then took “university” level math in grades 11 and 12, while applied students moved to “college” level math. Most subjects (English, French, sciences, and geography) are streamed in all grades, while some are not streamed at all, such as the arts, physical education, and Spanish.<br>The Government of Ontario is de-streaming grade ...</p>

I recently decided to take a chance and try out what is so highly regarded by students at Nepean.<br> S&amp;G Fries has the typical “shack menu”: fries, poutine, burgers, hot dogs, and chicken fingers, along with egg rolls from the Golden Bowl.

More often, we hear the names of William Shakespeare and Jane Austen, and while I respect and love Macbeth and Pride and Prejudice, there are some things they don’t offer that Wilde does. <br>Oscar Wilde was an impressive Irish playwright and poet who lived in London in the 1880’s.
