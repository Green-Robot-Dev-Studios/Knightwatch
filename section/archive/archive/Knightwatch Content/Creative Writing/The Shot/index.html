Anticipation, adrenaline, nerves, and tingling sensations crowding my thoughts. I began jumping up and down clearing my mind, my cleats coasting against the smooth touch of the freshly tended to turf field.</p><br><p>The dulcet whistle sang like the howl of a wolf calling his pack. Freedom. The second half was on. Quickly I turned to my wingback,</p><br><p>“Cover the long ball,”</p><br><p>He nodded; falling back into a defensive position.</p><br><p>I ran up the field taking a moment to observe the crowds on the sidelines pulsating like they were semi-sentient animals. Banners and signs brimming the sides of the field on every side, reading “OCSC vs OSU, the battle of the feet!”</p><br><p>I covered their right wingback, making sure he wouldn’t get the ball and play out through my side. He was belligerent and aggressive, but I held my ground, putting my arm high to push back. Suddenly I heard a shout from my teammate covering the middle area,</p><br><p>“Watch the switch” he blared.</p><br><p>Stubbornly thinking he was talking to another teammate, I stayed focused on their winger. However to my shock, a long heavy ball came from their center back across the field, slashing authoritatively through the air to their striker.</p><br><p>“Drop back,” shouted our coach,</p><br><p>Worn out from the first half’s hardships, feeling like I was using tottering pasta strings for legs, I sprinted back as fast as possible, in order to help my team. </p><br><p>Eyes sharp, my head high, arms heavy, I sprinted into a defensive position in front of my net, facing the play. The breath of my goalie brushing on the back of my neck, two strikers came darting towards me with a ball, I knew I couldn’t slide tackle or it would cause a penalty. My heart began to beat quicker, thundering in my thoughts, my hands began to tingle. </p><br><p>Thinking quickly at the sight, I cut off the threatening shooting angle. My eyes fixated on the second striker, cutting to the middle for an anticipated pass.</p><br><p>Coach exclaimed, “Cover the middle lan—”</p><br><p>But I was already there—I couldn’t feel my legs—but rather as if I were running on air with nobody whatsoever. I stole the ball mid-pass. Feeling confident, but quickly humbled by the intended enemy striker coming to cut off my anticipation. Time slowed, almost to a complete stop. In that moment, I could feel every sensation. The warm caress of the wind feeling against my exposed mid legs between my shorts and shin-pads, the scent of smoke bombs and clean but dirty cleats and jerseys, and the ear splitting sounds of parents roaring like active tigers, all extremely present.</p><br><p>Dribbling down the field with the ball, I quickly observed a tall, muscular defender rushing towards me as if we were two starved cheetahs meeting for the first time. Thinking quickly I acted going one direction, and went the other. Off balance and startled, the defender planted his cleat in the green perfect turf and tripped, a path of dark brown turf pellets following him.</p><br><p>I continued dashing down the field as fast as my legs could take me, dashing through waves of defenders like I was Barry Allen himself.</p><br><p>“Keep going!” teammates screamed.</p><br><p>“Head for goal!” others blurted.</p><br><p>I stayed humble—noticing the patches of birds flying over the field—the feeling of adrenaline growing stronger inside of me. </p><br><p>Left, right, cutting quickly and sharply through the pitch I headed straight for goal.</p><br><p>“Shoot! Shoot! Take a shot!” barked the crowds from every direction.</p><br><p>My heart thundered, my brain cleared, my muscles focused and composed. Nil scent, muted sound, precise sight, amplified by thousands.</p><br><p>My light foot lifted, sweeping turf pellets from the tampered ground, everyone was silent, my eyes on the ball, I took a deep breath in, held it, and sliced the ball with my left foot using a knuckleball technique. The gratifying chop of the ball allowed it to flow into the air.</p><br><p>My eyes followed the ball towards the goal—my ears eagerly anticipating the satisfying swish and swoosh of the soccer net—my body numb, relaxed.</p><br><p>The ball curved and twisted, taunting everyone on the pitch impatiently waiting for either a goal or a miss. </p><br><p>It finally made a decision.</p><br><p>I exhaled.</p>
