  <br><p>Here is a video our class made!</p><p><a href="https://vimeo.com/647432510"><u>https://vimeo.com/647432510</u></a></p><br><p>Hi everyone! We are the students of CGR4M; the environment resource management class, and we are so excited to give you all some tips and motivation on how to save our beautiful planet on which we all rely.</p><br><p>First off, did you know that changing your eating habits and consuming locally sourced food, can actually have huge positive impacts on our environment? By doing so and choosing to eat locally sourced food, you are not only supporting your local community but also simultaneously reducing your food miles! </p><p><br>Now, while food miles and air miles certainly sound similar, and in way they share similar meanings, food miles are quite different. See, food miles are the number of miles the produce or products you consume must travel to reach you, and by eating locally you actively reduce that carbon footprint. </p><br><p>Not totally convinced yet? Well let’s talk about how eating locally helps and supports your own local community. While local food can be said to taste better and last longer, buying from local businesses also allows for your community's economy to prosper and flourish. By creating valuable jobs, supporting families, and supporting the farmers who contribute to green infrastructure, you are making all the difference. </p><br><p>In the past, we didn’t have the fancy machines that brought us bananas in the winter, and coffee in the spring. And before it became so common to eat foods from all over the world, we ate according to the seasons and nature's natural cycles. Eating locally is essential, and that’s not to say you can’t have your bananas anymore, just maybe consider some Ontario grown strawberries first.</p><br><p><img src="data:image/png;base64,/9j/2wBDAAYEBQYFBAYGBQYHBwYIChAKCgkJChQODwwQFxQYGBcUFhYaHSUfGhsjHBYWICwgIyYnKSopGR8tMC0oMCUoKSj/2wBDAQcHBwoIChMKChMoGhYaKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCgoKCj/wAARCAAZAAoDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwABAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABgcDBP/EACUQAAIBAwMCBwAAAAAAAAAAAAECAwAEBRESMSFxBhUyNEGBkf/EABUBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUG/8QAHREBAAICAgMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQADAhEFEiExQf/aAAwDAQACEQMRAD8AVZawnlyMsov5kG70g0iiEgiQGZ+ij5qa5fB+KjfztHlEVSxKj670ggxWfEMYa/UnaNfzvQA+UbJZ2WujrjuZ32VvVyMu7G3jorcbeRpSSPKOY1PlV2NQOm2qVce5Wu0cUiUYHyCWcpZmAnqf/9k=" class="content-image lazyload" data-src="/section/archive/archive/Knightwatch Content/Social Issues/Benefits of Buying Local Food.jpeg"></p><br><p>Taking on Climate Change is in the hands of our governments and corporations, and we must apply pressure accordingly. That said, we each have our own responsibilities as well! Reducing our food miles is one of the cheapest and most effective means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lessening our own personal carbon footprint :) Firstly, locally sourced food doesn’t need to travel in those gas guzzling cars as far. Next, purchasing locally encourages sustainable agriculture — tracking the supply chain back to the point of origin is far easier when it is located in our neighborhood. When the farms and factories are close by, we are able to evaluate their size and how they treat the animals, crops and the environment. Also, seeing as we live in Ontario, food that is grown here has to pass strict safety standards and regulations. The usage of additives, pesticides, and herbicides which can be harmful to the environment and human health are highly regulated here, but food sourced from outside Canada may have much less stringent laws.</p><br><p>To conclude, buying locally helps the economy in your region as it creates jobs, contributes to improved public infrastructure, and keeps money invested in your community. Eating locally means we will be eating in season and get fresher, sweeter and perfectly ripe produce. Locally sourced food doesn’t need to travel as far, meaning people can feel more comfortable about where their food is from, and reduce carbon emissions. When we buy local food, we are able to keep a better eye on what's going on in our environment, so we can make informed choices.</p>
