Some people will play until they defeat the ender dragon (and arguably beat the game), while others will stick around to grab their loot. There are, however, a select few that will elect to stick with their worlds for hundreds (sometimes thousands) of hours. If you want the best chances of keeping your hardcore world for as long as possible, then this guide is for you. These are my personal tips to live by that I have learned in my thousands of hours in the game and 300+ hours playing hardcore.<br>Early game ...</p>
