  <p><img src="/section/opinion/knightwatch-tier-list.jpeg" class="content-image" /></p><p>All ratings are objective fact, also I haven’t seen all kids TV so cut me some slack.</p><p>S - Tier:</p><ul><li>Phineas and Ferb → Great theme song, Perry is pretty cool, poor Doofenshmirtz, S-tier</li><li>Star Wars: The Clone Wars → This is a bold one. It has Kenobi, it gets an S-tier. Also the rest of the show is really good, RIP Fives.</li><li>Adventure Time → Jake the Dog and Finn the human are pretty good, and who can dislike BMO?</li><li>Avatar: The Last Airbender → Great animation, great characters, great story. It's impossible not to love Uncle Iroh and Zuko. </li><li>Gravity Falls → Good characters and story, by far the best kid’s mystery show.</li><li>Pingu → He says noot noot and does a little trolling, S-tier.</li><li>Animated Batman → Mark Hamill Joker earns this S-tier easily. Also, we live in a society.</li><li>Veggie Tales → meme status, S-tier.</li></ul><p>A - Tier:</p><ul><li>The Backyardigans → Most of the characters are mediocre, but my man Pablo gets this up to an A-tier.</li><li>Spongebob → Is this the Krusty Krab? no this is A-tier</li><li>Dinosaur Train → Informative, has a pretty cool train, but the T-Rex should have eaten the other dinosaurs.</li><li>Wild Kratts → learned a lot, animation was cool, but the live actions segments keep this out of S-tier</li><li>The Regular Show → Pretty funny, but some episodes are just too weird to be good.</li><li>Transformers (1985) → Classic sci-fi cartoon, couldn’t really ask for more out of an 80’s cartoon.</li><li>Bill Nye → BILL! BILL! BILL! BILL! BILL! BILL! BILL!</li><li>The Amazing World of Gumball → Haven’t seen any full episodes, but the clips I have seen have been funny.</li><li>Mighty Machines → The machines are mighty, A-tier.</li><li>LEGO: Ninjago → Originally a really good show, but they just made too many seasons and suddenly the ice one is a robot for some reason and I lost interest.</li><li>The Dragon Prince → Made by the same people as ATLA so the characters and story are great, but the sometimes wonky animation keeps this out of S-tier.</li><li>Thomas the Tank Engine → This show kept my childhood on track, it’s pretty good.</li><li>Peppa Pig → Is canonically 7’1”, I can’t put her any lower than A-tier and keep my kneecaps.</li></ul><p>B - Tier:</p><ul><li>Dora → Pretty good for young children, but it gets real repetitive and annoying.</li><li>Blues Clues → Pretty cool show but Steve left the show and got replaced by a doppelganger, gets a B for Bye Steve!</li><li>Arthur → Some of the characters are pretty annoying, but at one point Arthur threatens to sell DW which makes up for the terrifying Matt Damon cameo.</li><li>Victorious/all laugh track sitcoms → Solid shows, laugh tracks get annoying after a few episodes.</li><li>Octonauts → Why is there a bear underwater?</li><li>Scooby-Doo → Gets predictable and the characters are not good enough to make up for the often dry stories.</li><li>Transformers Prime → Good story and animations, but can be kinda cringe at some points.</li><li>TMNT → Never watched much of this, but the one episode I did watch was alright.</li><li>Tom and Jerry → Cartoon violence is funny for a bit, then gets boring.</li><li>The Loud House → It was alright for a show about a pre-teen boy, but honestly just watch Fairly Odd Parents Instead.</li><li>Fairly Odd Parents → Cosmo and Wanda carry, Timmy is pretty annoying. The dad has S-tier meme status though.</li></ul><p>C - Tier:</p><ul><li>Johnny Test → Johnny is really annoying.</li><li>Miraculous Ladybug → Never watched it, but some of my friends did and they overhype it.</li><li>Teen Titans Go → Decent quality show, but jeez some of the characters are really annoying sometimes.</li><li>My Little Pony → The show was alright, but the community is... questionable.</li><li>Sesame Street → Cookie monster, Oscar the grouch, and Big bird make this show better than it has any right to be.</li><li>Star Wars: Rebels → Just clone wars but pretty much worse in every way.</li><li>Pokemon (all of them) →  Ash is really dumb and the show has no continuity with the game. The pokemon reputation alone keeps it out of F-tier though.</li></ul><p>D - Tier:</p><ul><li>Paw Patrol → Who let a dog drive a bulldozer? Only redeeming quality is the mayor’s chicken</li><li>The Wiggles → No one needs more wiggling in their life</li><li>Mickey Mouse Clubhouse → Mickey is terrifying, I have no idea who would be in a clubhouse with him</li><li>Shaun the Sheep → Can be funny, but the claymation although impressive, can be slight nightmare fuel</li></ul><p>F - Tier:</p><ul><li>Max and Ruby → Ruby is not my favourite character, let’s leave it at that.</li><li>Barney → What even is this show.</li><li>Teletubbies → Who came up with this show, because I think there is a padded cell with their name on it.</li><li>Richie Rich → He is a brat, what else do I need to say?</li><li>Skylanders: Academy → Bad video game show, automatic F-tier.</li></ul>
