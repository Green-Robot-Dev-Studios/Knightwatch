Three months in, I’ve learned a lot. I know I’m physically strong enough and I don’t know why I was so scared. So far it’s been an amazing season, but the three girls, myself included, have experienced moments that showed us that co-ed hockey (“boys hockey”) isn’t fully adjusted to the concept of girls in hockey.

Chris has been travelling across Canada, spreading his opinions on the terrors of gender ideology and gender affirming treatments. <br>On Monday the 18th of October, there was outrage at Chris’s presence during the beginning and end of the school day.
