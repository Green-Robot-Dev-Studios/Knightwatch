AI often elicits a sense of amazement, of wonder, of possibility for the future. But just as AI offers advancements, there are also potential consequences — machines are prone to bias, including racism. As Black History Month comes to an end, it’s important to recognize the racial issues in our tech-fueled world, where AI algorithms are present from security cameras to sending a text to your friend. Any bias in these algorithms can result in massive, systemic issues that disproportionately affect Black individuals.<br>These machines learn ...</p>

Did you  wonder who that person was? Or what he was standing by? For two weeks leading up to Remembrance Day, there was an exhibit set up outside Nepean High School. Kalan Saunder, an army cadet who attends Nepean, and our librarian, Ms. Mackechnie organized the “We Remember Learning Walk”. <br>Spring of 2020, Ms. Mackechnie learned about the idea of a learning walk from another teacher-librarian in Toronto, who took apart story books and pinned them ...</p>

More often, we hear the names of William Shakespeare and Jane Austen, and while I respect and love Macbeth and Pride and Prejudice, there are some things they don’t offer that Wilde does. <br>Oscar Wilde was an impressive Irish playwright and poet who lived in London in the 1880’s.

One would think that the Canadian Government would have a more regulated and convenient accessibility policy, yet 73% of disabled Canadians have faced major barriers when trying to use both federal and municipal organizations and businesses across Canada. Additionally, 4.1% of Ontarians (127,240 people) use a mobility aid. This shows that accessibility is a current issue in Canada.
