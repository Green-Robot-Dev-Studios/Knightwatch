Throughout the week, I spoke with Nepean High School students to better understand their opinions and to get an understanding of how they are coping with this latest shift. After interviewing these students, the consensus was clear: we were not ready to shift to in-person learning. Many kids were eager to share their thoughts on this divisive issue, and they had decisive opinions.</p><br><p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, students have switched between online classes and in person classes several times. So what’s different this time? According to a letter sent to all faculty of the OCDSB (Ottawa-Carleton District Schoolboard), students have each been given three ply cotton masks, while teachers have been given non-fit-tested N95 masks. In addition to the masks, the Ontario government will soon provide rapid antigen tests for students and staff in public elementary and secondary schools. The OCDSB will also be receiving an additional 81 standalone HEPA filter units in addition to the 2300 units already in place. Furthermore, several tighter protocols have been put in place, including stricter class and lunch cohorting and elevated cleaning requirements — but schools will now only report COVID-19 cases once 30% of the school’s population is absent.</p><br><p>Overwhelmingly, students do not consider a reopening at this time to be the best course of action. Most would have preferred a reopening at the end of the semester, a more natural breakpoint in our learning. This would have given us a more consistent learning environment for the rest of the semester. Another pain point for students is the case reporting. Most students reported feeling uncomfortable not knowing about cases until the 30% threshold is reached.</p><br><p>Some of the students interviewed were among the unlucky few that were in isolation. They provided interesting insights into the online learning experience. Their experience was clear: learning online while others were in person was simply not as “rich” of an experience, and teachers couldn’t be expected to manage two models of classroom learning at the same time. While some teachers have given students the option to stay home and learn remotely through live meetings, most are not offering an equal level of integration.</p><br><p>In light of these conditions, the TDSB (Toronto District School Board) has made the decision to freeze grades, so they cannot be negatively impacted by online learning. Some students are supportive of grade freezing in the OCDSB as well. They claim that when presented with the option of going to school or staying home and opting to learn online, they may feel forced to pick academics over health; grade freezing could make students more inclined to choose the safer option.</p><br><p>Every student I spoke to had either known someone or was themselves infected by the virus. This concerning remark stands in sharp contrast from the previous reopenings, where infections were few and far between. These personal anecdotes created a stronger sense of caution for students.</p><br><p>Ultimately, students are largely unhappy about these changes, and will support a grade freeze. Whilst this situation is unfortunately an unpleasant one, we, the students, are all hopeful for a cheerier second semester.</p>
