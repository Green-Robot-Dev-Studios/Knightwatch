      <h1 class="times">About Knightwatch</h1>
      <div class="blurb">We acknowledge that Nepean High School is on the unceded, unsurrendered Territory of the Anishinaabe Algonquin Nation. We would like to thank them for their continued stewardship of this territory on Turtle Island post-colonially known as Ottawa. We appreciate that their connection and presence here reaches back to time immemorial. We recognize the historical and current suppression of Indigenous voices in the media and elsewhere, so as a school newspaper, we are committed to providing an open and safe platform for Indigenous students to share their writing and artwork. <br><br> Knightwatch is Nepean High School’s online newspaper, written by students, for students. Anyone at our school is welcome to share with us their creations, which we publish in our monthly issues. We accept articles, poetry, short stories, reviews, photography, artwork, music, and anything else really. Our goal is to provide NHS students with a platform to show off their creativity and be inspired by the projects of their peers.</div>
